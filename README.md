# Random Password Generator

In this project, I've created an application which generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
